* Version      : Applilet4 for RL78/L13 V1.00.00.02 [10 May 2013]
* Device(s)    : R5F10WMG
* Tool-Chain   : CA78K0R
* H/W Platform : RSKRL78L13
* Note         : Application Leading Tool (Applilet) is used to generate code 
*                for this sample program.  The name Applilet is used hereafter.
*                The Applilet details and version number are given in the file 
*                header for each relevant module.
* Description  : Demonstrates usage of the IIC interface in master mode, by reading and 
*                writing to an EEPROM device. 
*
* Option Bytes : Option bytes for the microcontroller are set in the CubeSuite+ IDE. Select the build tool in the 
*                project tree window, click the link options tab and open the "Device" section. 
*                The default option byte value is 0xEFFFF0
*          
*                Works with the Renesas R1EX24xxx series, 16Kbit EEPROM and 
*                compatible devices. The EEPROM device should be in a circuit
*                recommended by the manufacturer to ensure it is operational. 
*                Alternately, the project can be configured to work with another 
*                RSKRL78L13 running the slave program. The user can select the 
*                appropriate slave device by the inclusion or exclusion of the 
*                macro definition '#define SLAVE_RL78L13', which is found in the 
*                r_cg_userdefine.h header file.  By default this sample is configured
*                to work with the EEPROM device,
*                
* Modifications: The IIC pull-up resistors are connected to Board_VDD by default.
*                This is correct for power configurations where Board_VDD is 5V.
*                For power configurations where Board_VDD is 3.3V, the IIC pull-up resistors
*                should be connected to Board_5V, by removing R5 and fitting R6.
*                
*                Please refer to the schematics document and component placement 
*                diagram in the User Manual to help locate components. 
*                
* Instructions : 1. Connect a compatible EEPROM memory device as follows:
*
*                   EEPROM  |   RSK
*                   -------------------------------            
*                   SDA    ->   SDA (JA1, pin 25)
*                   SCL    ->   SCL (JA1, pin 26)
*                   GND    ->   Any ground point.
*
*                   (Ensure the device is powered as its datasheet specifies)
*        
*                 2. Build and download the sample code to the RSK.
*
*                 3. Click the 'Go' button to start program execution. "IICM" will be displayed on the
*                    bottom line of the LCD.
*                   
*                 4. Press switch SW1 to perform a write operation. If the write is successful,
*                    the LCD displays show the data sent to the EEPROM, address location 0, in the
*                    middle line in the first character location of the LCD. 'M-WR' is also shown
*                    in the bottom line of the LCD.
*                    
*                 5. Press switch SW3 to perform a read operation. The read data will be compared to the
*                    the data written in step 4, and the result will be displayed in the
*                    middle line in the third character location of the LCD. 'M-RD' is also shown
*                    in the bottom line of the LCD.
*
* Note:          If the IIC slave becomes unresponsive, stop the sample and disconnect power to the RSK,
*                recheck the EEPROM connections, then reconnect power and start from step 1 again. 
*                An error message will be displayed on the LCD if a read operation is performed as the first operation.
*
